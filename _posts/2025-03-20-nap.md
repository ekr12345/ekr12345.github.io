A good nap is essential to my work routine—without one, my productivity falls off a cliff by mid-day.

What I like to do is hop into bed for no more than 30 to 40 minutes after I’ve had a bite to eat. After that, I wake up and move on to my next task. I use naps to split my day into two parts. Pre-nap, I focus on deep work—strategy and creative tasks. Post-nap, I shift to the more mundane or straightforward stuff.

Now, to be fair, I work remotely, so it’s probably not realistic to suggest naps for someone who has to commute to the office every day.

Then again, maybe companies that require in-office work should implement a napping code of conduct.

This is actually pretty common in Japan, and there’s even a word for it—inemuri.

These types of naps require you to be present while sleeping. In other words, it’s OK to doze off, but as soon as you're asked to do something—you’d better be ready to take action.

Maybe this isn’t the perfect solution, but hey, it’s better than nothing. 

P.S. Don't tell my boss about this.
