It's happening again.

Things are getting too comfortable. This always happens around this time of year. I know I shouldn't complainâ€”after all, times are tough for a lot of people.

But the idea of being too comfortable has never sat well with me. Maybe one day I'll look back and tell myself I took the easy life for granted.

I moved abroad to Japan ten years ago and returned to Canada nearly three years later.

Since then, I've stayed put in Vancouver, doing the same job.

Is it time for a change? Perhaps the start of a new act overseas?

I don't know.

On one hand, it would probably make for an interesting adventure. On the other, it could be a risky career move.

But then again, it seems like a lot of people are breaking out of their comfortable lives for something new.
