I work remote and I've become more social because of it.

I'll work out of cafes, libraries, and food courts.

I'll take breaks at random and visit local shops, record stores, and restaurants.

And guess what? many of the regular faces I've come across have become great friends. 

Working remotely doesn't have to be a lonely experience.

Why I love remote work. 

I don't dread traffic. 

I start work with a fresh mind.

I have the freedom to take much needed walks. 

I have more energy throughout the week. Because I don't spend X amount of time in traffic, I don't mind working a bit extra on weekends.

I'm don't like rigidness. I work best in a flexible enviornment. 

I meet others, exchange ideas.

Build friendships.

I'm more motivated to work.

Business has grown.
