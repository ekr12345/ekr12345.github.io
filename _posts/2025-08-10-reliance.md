I’m noticing that I'm being (a bit) overly dependent on ChatGPT.

For example, in Japanese—a language I’m actively trying to master—I’ve gotten into the habit of running my text messages through ChatGPT to check accuracy before sending them. It’s a bad habit, because it pucks up the learning process and keeps me from developing the fluency I’m aiming for.

I think I notice this more with Japanese because I’m so conscious of my goal to improve. With English, my native language, I don’t feel the same hesitation about relying on ChatGPT for all kinds of tasks—even though that reliance can also weaken my skills over time, like my ability to write well or process long-form content.
