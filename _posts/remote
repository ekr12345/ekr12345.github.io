I work remote. 

I've come across articles mentioning that remote work is *bad* for business, *bad* for career advancement, and *bad* for your social-well beiing. 

What?

My company no-longer has an in office policy. We're all remote.

And guess what? The company has grown year-over-year, for the last 5 years. 

I've developed some routines ever since I've started working remote that go against the standard office environment.

Usually, after two hours of continuous work, I'll go for long walks - these generally last 1 to 2 hours. I'll usually explore the areas around my community, interact with local business owners, and say hi to the regulars at some of the cafes I visit. 

Wait a second, is this to say that remote work as made me *more social*? Well, it has!

Walks are the key to my remote work routine. Walking in nature generally kicks ass especially when you're staring at your screen all day.
