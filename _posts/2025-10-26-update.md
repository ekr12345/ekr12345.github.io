Just a quick update.

My open-source adventure continues.

Goodbye, Windows. Hello, Linux. I went with Ubuntu, and things have been gravy so far, thanks to some great YouTube tutorials and ChatGPT.

Next:

I installed Brave on my Android and iPad. Why didn’t I do this earlier? It blocks those pesky ads at no cost. Highly recommended.

Lastly, I paid off the mortgage apartment (here in Vancouver!). I’m 37.

This would never have been possible without living at home for as long as I did. If you can take advantage of low (or no) rent living, do it!

There’s a lot of talk about whether it’s better to invest in the markets rather than pay off a mortgage. I was originally in favor of the former, but over time my opinion changed. Here’s a quick rundown of why I got rid of my mortgage ASAP:

  <li>Peace of mind
  <li>Increased savings rate


With that out of the way, I think some big changes are on the horizon. Stay tuned.
