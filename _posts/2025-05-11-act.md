After reading Will Mannon's inspiring [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-my-life-week-comedian-china-will-mannon-flksc) about becoming a Chinese-speaking comedian, I've been contemplating what's next for Eric. (Don't worry, I have no desire to become a Japanese-speaking comedian anytime soon.)

What I love about Will's post are the tiny details that have made his second act so special. I love the human element and the connections that have grown as a positive side effect.

    <p>I’m ushered up to a rooftop. Barbecue smoke sizzles over rows of grills. Late afternoon sunlight blankets the Kunming skyline in orange-gold glow. Chefs, swanky guests, a table set to the nines, a stage, a microphone….a grin floods my face. How is this my life? February was my first open mic. It went terribly. But I returned for night two with a fresh five minutes and a defiant attitude. Went much better. And just like that, I was hooked. Ten weeks later, this rooftop gig will be my 73rd show (including ~20 paid). I accidentally became a professional standup comedian in China.</p>

It's a breath of fresh air to see someone not compromising their dreams in order to jump on trends. More often than not, I (we?) get sucked into the vortex of sacrificing our goals for what makes "sense."
