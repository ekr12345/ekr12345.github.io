After reading Will Mannon's inspiring post about becoming a Chinese-speaking comedian, I've been contemplating what's next for Eric. (Don't worry, I have no desire to become a Japanese-speaking comedian anytime soon.)

What I love about Will's post are the tiny details that have made his second act so special. I love the human element and the connections that have grown as a positive side effect.

It's a breath of fresh air to see someone not compromising their dreams in order to jump on trends. More often than not, I (we?) get sucked into the vortex of compromising our goals for what makes "sense."
