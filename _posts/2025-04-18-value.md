A lot of the creative work I do brings value — but not in the monetary sense. And that’s perfectly OK. In fact, sometimes I think if I did [x] for money, I’d end up quitting.

There’s a trend in today’s creator world that everything we do should be monetized.

Why is that?

I think it’s because it’s easier to measure value when there’s a number attached to it.

Bullshit.

Most of the creative work I do earns little to no money. Yes, it’d be nice to monetize, but I’ll wait until I receive permission to do so.
