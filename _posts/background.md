Whenever I host a get-together, I take full responsibility for creating a comfortable environment.

A clean space.
Soft lighting.
And, of course, background music.

I’m not spinning records for a dance floor, but I’m still playing the role of a DJ—just for a different kind of crowd.

Background music is there to enhance the atmosphere, not dominate it. 

A guest nodding to the beat, making a quick comment about the track, then diving right back into a meaningful conversation? That’s the sweet spot. That’s when I know I’ve nailed it.
