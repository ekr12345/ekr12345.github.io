It's no secret that social media companies want to keep us engaged—or rather, addicted—because that's how they make their money.

That's why I decided to delete my social media accounts and start this site.

Having my own site encourages me to spend more time creating.

Social media pushed me to spend more time mindlessly consuming.

Having my own site allows me focus.

Social media wanted to wreck my attention span.

Having my own site encourages me to share my work with *real* friends.

Social media wanted me to think that every follower (and bot) was a *real* friend. 

I could go on but you probably already get the point.
