The morning dread is long gone.

The dread of knowing it would take me hours to get to and from the office.

The dread of knowing my eight-hour day would, most likely, become ten hours.

Long days would become even longer.

Thankfully, that's all over now.

I now work remotely.

I work out of caf√©s, libraries, and food courts.

I take breaks at random and visit local shops, record stores, and restaurants.

I help family when they need me.

I go for long walks in nature when I need a break.

Now I wonder if I could ever go back to the office.
