I know too much about things I shouldn't.

And quite frankly, it pisses me off. 

Quitting social media helped. However, due to the nature of my work, I sometimes get sucked into the dopamine vortex.

The question I'm asking myself right now is, "How can I know *less*?". 

I guess there needs to be more contraints on what I consume (content I read, watch, listen to). 

That's the problem with digital, it's far too easy to scroll, open, and close. 

That's the beauty with physical, it's far more difficult to ignore, discard, and rush through.
