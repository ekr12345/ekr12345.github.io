Tokyo, Bucharest, Miami, Vancouver, oh my. These are some of the places I've been able to perform as a DJ. 

Overtime, things have slowed down. I no longer seek events, release music on labels, and so on. 
  
Instead, I chose to keep it as a hobby—one where I have full creative control—while building a rewarding career that gives me peace of mind. 
  
I'm happy. 
  
But that doesn’t mean I don’t have a set of rules guiding my creative pursuits. I value the creative work I do, and I want audiences to know this.

new connections, people.

no social media.


Rule 1
I do not use social media.
Social media thrives on short-form content and endless scrolling. The moment I share my art there, its value drops to zero—it gets lost in a digital world that doesn’t encourage careful listening.
My art is not meant to be listened to through low-quality mobile speakers for 15-seconds. 
Algorithms, promoters, labels, care about statistics. I care about my art. I don't let distractions get in the way, such as follower counts, likes, and trends. 

I don't send music promos digitally.
I'll mention this again. The moment my art becomes digitized, the value flops to zero. 

Some art collectors still perceive digital art as less valuable due to its lack of tangibility and the potential for easy reproduction. The perception that digital art is less prestigious remains a barrier to its widespread acceptance.

I'll DJ for free, but I won't DJ for cheap.
In the business world, it’s better to do a project for free than to do it for cheap. Pricing your work too low can send the wrong message—it creates the perception that your work isn’t valuable. Once you establish yourself as "cheap," it becomes difficult to break free from that label. People will always expect the same low rates, and raising your prices later can feel like an uphill battle.

On the other hand, when you work for free, you’re setting your own terms. You retain creative control, and most importantly, you remove the expectation of "cheap labor." Instead, your work speaks for itself. If you deliver quality, people take notice. Those who truly value your skills will be willing to pay a premium for your next project because they’ve already seen the level of excellence you bring.

I take this same approach to DJing. When I choose to play for free, it’s not because I don’t see value in my craft—it’s because I want to showcase my art on my own terms. It allows me to focus on creating meaningful experiences without worrying about financial expectations. And when the right opportunity comes along, I can set my price, knowing that my work justifies it.

In the end, perception matters. Doing something for free can be a strategic investment, while doing it for cheap can undervalue your talent in the long run.

Hell Yes, Hell No
If I get asked to DJ and my answer is not Hell Yes, then it's a Hell No.
