<p>Based in and around Vancouver. Working on a couple of music projects. I eventually want to release physical copies of my work (vinyl, CD, tape, and maybe MiniDisc). </p>

<p>Meeting founders both offline and online in hopes of working together. I'm not limiting myself to software (think restaurants, cafes, and events). </p>

<p>Grinding away at Japanaese. Keeping up my reading habit (2000ish words per week), 5x tutor sessions, and a mix-bag of consuming enjoyable content. </p>

<p>I'm back to playing ice hockey. It's always great to shoot some pucks with the crew. <p>
