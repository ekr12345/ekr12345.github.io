Hi,

So you want to know a bit more about who I am and what I do?

Well, my name's Eric, and this site is where I casually share my thoughts.

I live a somewhat nomadic lifestyle due to the nature of my work. I work fully remotely, which is why I travel more than most.

My professional background is a mixed bag of events, marketing, and sales. To be honest, I much prefer the sales side of things—success is easier to quantify.

I'm borderline minimalist. My apartment isn’t cluttered with unnecessary furniture—I don’t even have a TV.

I’ve deleted all my social media accounts, but I’m still active on LinkedIn and find value in YouTube.

Long walks tend to solve most of my problems.

Topics I'm currently interested in include the neuroscience behind music, alternatives to big tech, scaling sales teams, and the evolution of work.

P.S. This page is a work in progress and is subject to change.
