Hi,

So you want to know a bit more about who I am and what I do?

Well, my name's Eric, and this site is where I casually share my thoughts.

I'm based in Vancouver, but I also try to spend part of the year in Japan. I used to live in Tokyo, but these days, I find myself spending less time in the capital and opting for lesser-known places. I prefer traveling to meet people rather than just to see places.

I live a somewhat nomadic lifestyle due to the nature of my work. I work fully remotely, which is why I travel more than most.

My professional background is a mixed bag of events, marketing, and sales. To be honest, I much prefer the sales side of things—success is easier to quantify.

I'm borderline minimalist. My apartment isn’t cluttered with unnecessary furniture—I don’t even have a TV.

I’ve deleted all my social media accounts, but I’m still active on LinkedIn and find value in YouTube.

I spent much of my 20s immersed in electronic music, both as a DJ and producer. These days, I do less of it but still feel the urge to create. Other hobbies include ice hockey, language learning, investing, video games, working out, and reading.

Long walks tend to solve most of my problems.

P.S. This page is a work in progress and is subject to change.
