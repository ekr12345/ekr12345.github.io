  Me
</h1>


  <p>
    Eric here. I'm from Vancouver and have lived here for most of my life (with a short stint in Tokyo).
  </p>

  <p>
    My professional life revolves around sales, marketing, and business development within the EdTech industry. I've been with the same company for seven years now—which feels like a lifetime in tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work remotely and often travel (mostly to Japan) for a good part of the year. Why Japan? Well, it's a country I like to call my home away from home. I speak Japanese, many of my friends are spread across Japan (mainly in Fukuoka, Osaka, and Tokyo), and I love 銭湯.
  </p>

  <p>
    I probably have too many hobbies. I've played ice hockey for most of my life. In my twenties, I started DJing and producing music, and in my thirties, I taught myself Japanese. I don't enjoy watching sports—I’d much rather play them. When it comes to music, I love all genres, but electronic music will always be my main preference. As for languages, I plan to become fully fluent in Japanese someday. I'm always contemplating whether or not to move back to Japan for a year of self-led immersion. Maybe soon.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a passive investor. I don’t spend much money on products—but I’m happy to spend generously on travel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although I'm an extrovert, I also enjoy time alone (usually reading or researching). I don’t use social media, but I do use LinkedIn.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're a moron or caught up in the far-right or far-left frenzy, I don't think we'll get along. But if you're optimistic, creative, and open-minded—we can chill.
