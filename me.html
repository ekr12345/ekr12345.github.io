  <p>Hi,</p>

  <p>
    Eric here. I'm from Vancouver and have lived here for most of my life (with a short stint in Tokyo). I love <strong>銭湯</strong> (public baths).

  <p>
    My professional life revolves around sales, marketing, and business development within the EdTech industry. I've been with the same company for seven years now—which feels like a lifetime in tech.

  <p>
    I work fully remotely and often travel (mostly to Japan) for a good part of the year. Why Japan? Well, it's a country I like to call my home away from home. I speak Japanese, many of my friends are spread across Japan (mainly in Fukuoka, Osaka, and Tokyo), and I love <strong>銭湯</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I probably have too many hobbies. I've played ice hockey for most of my life. In my twenties, I started DJing and producing music, and in my thirties, I taught myself Japanese. Ironically, I don't enjoy watching sports—I’d much rather play them. When it comes to music, I love all genres, but electronic music will always be my main preference. As for languages, I plan to become fully fluent in Japanese someday. I'm always contemplating whether or not to move back to Japan for a year of self-led immersion. Maybe soon.

    I'm not a fan of drugs
