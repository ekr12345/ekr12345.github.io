  <p>Hi,</p>

  <p>So you want to know a bit more about who I am and what I do?</p>

  <p>Well, my name’s Eric, and this site is where I casually share my thoughts.</p>

  <p>I live a somewhat nomadic lifestyle due to the nature of my work. I work fully remotely, which is why I travel more than most.</p>

  <p>My professional background is a mixed bag of events, marketing, and sales. To be honest, I much prefer the sales side of things—success is easier to quantify.</p>

  <p>I’m borderline minimalist. My apartment isn’t cluttered with unnecessary furniture—I don’t even have a TV.</p>

  <p>I’ve deleted all my social media accounts, but I’m still active on LinkedIn and find value in YouTube.</p>

  <p>Long walks tend to solve most of my problems.</p>

  <p>Topics I’m currently interested in include the neuroscience behind music, alternatives to big tech, scaling sales teams, and the evolution of work.</p>

  <p><em>P.S. This page is a work in progress and is subject to change.</em></p>
